Basically this is trying to write a time lapse camera that runs on a regular pre-determined schedule, something like daily at 7am till 6pm

Written to take Time Lapse video of my new house construction

Recently updated to run on a pixel 3

Uses [SunriseSunset library](https://github.com/caarmen/SunriseSunset) to calculate sunset/sunrise times so the built-in schedule now tracks
daylight hours.
